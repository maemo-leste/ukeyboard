** Keyboard layout compiler for Nokia N800 and N810 (OS2008) **

Distributed under GPLv2.
(Except doc/vkb-format-v3, which is placed into public domain; see the file
for more info.)

Based on the following sources:
- source code of gen_vkb tool for Nokia 770
- reverse engineering of .vkb data files from Nokia N800 and N810

Note that the input format is different than the one used by the gen_vkb
tool. This tool uses a plain text file which is (contrary to XML) much more
easier to write when creating the layout by hand.

See doc/howto for instructions how to create a custom on-screen keyboard layout.
Look at xkb/ukeyboard if you want to create a custom sliding keyboard layout.
