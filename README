** Keyboard layout compiler for Nokia N800 **

Distributed under GPLv2.

Based on the following sources:
- source code of gen_vkb tool for Nokia 770
- reverse engineering of .vkb data files from Nokia N800

Note that the input format is different than the one used by the gen_vkb
tool. This tool uses a plain text file which is (contrary to XML) much more
easier to write when creating the layout by hand.

The format is not documented but should be quite straightforward; see
the attached Czech keyboard definition for an example.

For a description what those various key types mean, see
http://maemo.org/development/documentation/how-tos/3-x/howto_him_bora.html#vkb

Note that kind of keys other than "Normal" and "Sliding" are not supported.
Also, the "Whitespace" attribute is treated in the input file like a kind of
key, not like an attribute.
